/**
 * The COVID-19 Immunization Module uses actual data to predict whether someone will get a vaccine
 * during the time period for which data is available. As of writing, this is December 2020
 * through July 2021. The data provides administration information for particular age ranges. This
 * is used to model the likelihood that an individual will get the vaccine.
 *
 * What is unknown is the likelihood that someone will get the vaccine for the period after which
 * we have data. Just because someone who is 70 years old has not been vaccinated by July of 2021
 * does not mean that they will never be vaccinated.
 *
 * This class models those individuals. Chance of vaccination is again based on age, with the chance
 * of vaccination declining by half every two week. Eventually, the chance of vaccination hits a
 * threshold where the individual will move into a state where they will never attempt to get the
 * vaccine.
 *
 * This model assigns a much higher chance for those 15 and younger to attempt to get the vaccine
 * as that population has not been eligible for very long at the time of writing.
