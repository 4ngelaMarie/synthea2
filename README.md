# Synthea Patient Generator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/synthetichealth/synthea.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/synthetichealth/synthea)

Synthea is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulator. The goal is to output synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats.

Read our [wiki](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki) for more information.

Currently, Synthea features:
- Birth to Death Lifecycle
- Modular Rule System
  - Drop in [Generic Modules](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Generic-Module-Framework)
  - Custom Ruby rules modules for additional capabilities
- Primary Care Encounters and Emergency Room Encounters
- Conditions, Allergies, Medications, Vaccinations, Observations/Vitals, Labs
- Formats
 - FHIR (STU3)
 - C-CDA

## Quick Start

### Installation

**System Requirements:** Synthea requires macOS or Linux with Ruby 2.0.0 or above. (While Windows is not officially supported, it is possible to get it running on Windows)

The output of C-CDA documents requires Mongo DB.
```
brew install mongodb
mongod &
```

To clone the Synthea repo and install the necessary gems:
```
git clone https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea.git
cd synthea
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

### Generate Synthetic Patients
Generating an entire population at once...

```
bundle exec rake synthea:generate
```
Or generating the population one at a time...

```
bundle exec rake synthea:sequential
```

Or generating the population for a county a time based on census statistics...

```
bundle exec rake synthea:sequential['./config/Suffolk_County.json']
```

Some settings can be changed in `./config/synthea.yml`.

Synthea will output patient records in C-CDA (requires running instance of Mongo DB) and FHIR STU3 formats in `./output`.

### Upload to FHIR Server
After generating data, upload it to a STU3 server
```
bundle exec rake synthea:fhirupload[http://server/fhir/baseDstu3]
```

### Synthea GraphViz
Generate a graphical visualization of Synthea rules. Requires GraphViz to be installed.

```
brew install graphviz
bundle exec rake synthea:graphviz
```
