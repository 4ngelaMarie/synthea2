    class Immunizations < Synthea::Rules

      # This is a complete, but fairly simplistic approach to synthesizing immunizations.  It is encounter driven;
      # whenever an encounter occurs, the doctor checks for due immunizations and gives them.  In at least one case
      # (HPV) this means that the immunization schedule isn't strictly followed since the encounter schedule doesn't
      # match the immunization schedule (e.g., 11yrs, 11yrs2mo, 11yrs6mo) -- but in most cases they do line up.
      # This module also assumes perfect doctors and compliant patients.  Every patient eventually receives every
      # recommended immunization (unless they die first).  This module also does not implement any deviations or
      # contraindications based on patient conditions.  For now, we've avoided specific brand names, preferring the
      # general CVX codes.

      # Blank rule to show relationship between immunizations and age
